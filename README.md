# hotd-shield-discordbot
Discord bot that allows Heroes of the Dark players to self-report their shields and share with friends.

### Usage
The bot will listen for commands starting with the text "!shield" in any channel it has access to. It will then expect a duration in hours, separated by a space and directly following the command. Anything written after the duration will be concatenated into a description, intended to contain information about where to find the shielded mansion (e.g. Toffmore).
